## E-shop applcation

## Project structure
The project contains the UI and the api 


## Local development
We use docker for the local development

- Make sure you have [Docker][https://www.docker.com/] installed on your system.

- Create `.env` file in the project root directory and copy env variables in `env.example` into `.env` file.

- Start the docker containers by running, `docker-compose up -d` 

- If all is good, you should be able to access the api on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and the UI on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
